abstract:  In this contemporary era, the significance of wind energy is increasing enormously to address the energy crisis.
 Theaerodynamic efficiency of a wind turbine is heavily influenced by the blade’s airfoil profile and selecting an appropriate
 profile is essential. A numerical (CFD) based investigation is conducted on the NACA 4412 airfoil profile by modifying
 the leading-edge flap angle in order to assess the impact on the aerodynamic performance of wind turbine blades. The
 governing equations, incorporating the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model, were solved using the commercial software
 ANSYS FLUENT CFD algorithm, and structured grid was constructed using ANSYS ICEM CFD. In this investigation,
 the leading-edge flap angle (at 20% chord) of NACA 4412 was varied with a 2° interval between 8° up flap to 8° down
 flap, for a total of nine airfoil configurations. The Reynolds number (Re) used in this investigation was 0.3 million whereas
 the angle of attack ranged from 0° to 20°, with 1° increments. The research examined and reported the impact of varying
 leading-edge flap angles on the lift coefficient (CL), drag coefficient (CD), and lift-to-drag ratio (CL/CD) at different angles
 of attack. In order to comprehend the aerodynamic properties and flow physics, the influence of flap angles on the velocity
 and pressure distributions surrounding the airfoil was examined and visually illustrated. The 8° down flap configuration
 exhibited the highest aerodynamics performance, achieved by a maximum lift-to-drag ratio (CL/CD) enhancement of 10.7%
 compared to the NACA 4412 base profile.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study uses CFD simulations to analyze 16 configurations of the NACA6309 airfoil with trailing-edge flaps, finding that a 1° up-flap offers the best aerodynamic performance while the 10° down-flap performs the worst.

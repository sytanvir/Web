abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a critical technology in mobile robotics, yet the evaluation metrics for the quality of SLAM-generated maps are scattered and often fail to capture crucial aspects like true area, noise, and structural integrity. This paper consolidates existing evaluation methods and proposes four novel metrics to address these shortcomings. We provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating 2D SLAM-generated maps by analyzing metrics both with and without ground truth. To demonstrate this framework, four prevalent SLAM algorithms (Gmapping, Hector SLAM, Karto SLAM, and CRSM SLAM) were implemented in a simulated Gazebo environment. A quantitative performance analysis was conducted using the consolidated and novel metrics. The results show that no single metric can provide a complete evaluation, and different algorithms excel in different aspects. The guidance and analysis presented in this paper serve as a critical resource for researchers to benchmark algorithms and for engineers to optimize system performance, ultimately advancing the field of autonomous navigation.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper presents a unified framework for evaluating 2D SLAM map quality, introducing four novel metrics to assess area accuracy, noise, and structural integrity. A comprehensive analysis of four SLAM algorithms demonstrates the necessity of using multiple metrics for a complete performance evaluation.

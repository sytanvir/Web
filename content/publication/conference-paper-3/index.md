abstract:  In this contemporary era, the significance of wind energy is increasing enormously to address the energy crisis. Theaerodynamic efficiency of a wind turbine is heavily influenced by the blade’s airfoil profile and selecting an appropriate profile is essential. A numerical (CFD) based investigation is conducted on the NACA 4412 airfoil profile by modifying the leading-edge flap angle in order to assess the impact on the aerodynamic performance of wind turbine blades. The governing equations, incorporating the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model, were solved using the commercial software ANSYS FLUENT CFD algorithm, and structured grid was constructed using ANSYS ICEM CFD. In this investigation, the leading-edge flap angle (at 20% chord) of NACA 4412 was varied with a 2° interval between 8° up flap to 8° down flap, for a total of nine airfoil configurations. The Reynolds number (Re) used in this investigation was 0.3 million whereas the angle of attack ranged from 0° to 20°, with 1° increments. The research examined and reported the impact of varying leading-edge flap angles on the lift coefficient (CL), drag coefficient (CD), and lift-to-drag ratio (CL/CD) at different angles of attack. In order to comprehend the aerodynamic properties and flow physics, the influence of flap angles on the velocity and pressure distributions surrounding the airfoil was examined and visually illustrated. The 8° down flap configuration exhibited the highest aerodynamics performance, achieved by a maximum lift-to-drag ratio (CL/CD) enhancement of 10.7% compared to the NACA 4412 base profile.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study optimizes the NACA 4412 airfoil for wind turbine blades, finding that an 8° down flap angle improves aerodynamic efficiency by enhancing the lift-to-drag ratio by 10.7%.

abstract: Renewable energy in the industrial sector is a key step in achieving low-carbon production systems. CSP technologies can generate electricity by converting sunlight energy to power a turbine. This study investigates the optical efficiency of hillside CSP systems in the U.S.

summary: The study finds that an inclined V-shape heliostat layout in hillside CSP systems yields higher optical efficiency than traditional layouts across various U.S. locations.

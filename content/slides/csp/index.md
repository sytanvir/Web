# Slide 1: Introduction to CSP

Welcome to the **Concentrated Solar Power (CSP)** presentation!

CSP is a technology used to generate electricity by converting sunlight into heat, which is then used to power a turbine.

- **Benefit 1**: Efficiency in generating electricity.
- **Benefit 2**: Cost-effective in certain regions.
- **Benefit 3**: Clean and renewable energy.

---

# Slide 2: How CSP Works

CSP systems use mirrors or lenses to concentrate sunlight onto a receiver, which collects the heat and converts it into energy.

- **Step 1**: Sunlight is reflected onto a central tower.
- **Step 2**: The heat is used to produce steam, which turns a turbine.

# Slide 3: Advantages of Hillside Layouts

Using **hillside areas** for CSP systems offers several advantages:

- **Natural Terrain**: The terrain naturally optimizes heliostat (mirror) placement.
- **Better Efficiency**: With better positioning, optical efficiency increases.

# Slide 4: The Future of CSP

- **Ongoing Research**: Improving materials used for CSP technology.
- **Global Expansion**: CSP technology is expanding, especially in deserts and remote areas.

# Slide 5: Challenges of CSP

Despite its benefits, CSP also faces some challenges:

- **High Initial Costs**: Requires significant upfront investment.
- **Land Availability**: Needs large areas of land to be effective.
- **Energy Storage**: Storing energy for non-sunny days is still a challenge.

# Slide 6: Conclusion

**Key Findings:**

- Hillside layouts for CSP increase optical efficiency.
- CSP is a promising technology for clean energy, but challenges remain.

**Future Directions:**

- Focus on improving energy storage solutions.
- Explore new materials to enhance performance.
